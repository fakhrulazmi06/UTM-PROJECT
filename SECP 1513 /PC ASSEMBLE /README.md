In this day,l am with my group members learn how to assemble pc until the pc work perfectly. PC assembling involves putting together separate computer hardware components to create a fully functioning system. In this task, we gained hands on experience in identifying components, installing them correctly, and understanding their roles in the overall performance of a PC.The activity also taught us the importance of accuracy, safety, and careful handling of hardware. This experience strengthened our basic knowledge of computer systems and increased our confidence in working with computer hardware.Thank for all lecturers that involved in this program especially our Dr.Azurah that arrange the program for us.
