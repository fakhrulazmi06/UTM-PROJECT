🖥️ Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd Industry talk 🗣️| 18 December 2025

I attended an industry talk titled “Project Management and System Development” organised by the Faculty of Computing. The session was presented by Ts. Abdul Alim Abdul Muttalib, Head of Technology and Innovation at Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. The talk provided useful insights into how projects and systems are managed in real industry environments.

During the session,the speaker explained the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and compared the Waterfall and Agile approaches. He highlighted how proper planning plays a major role in ensuring project success. In addition, he discussed the increasing use of artificial intelligence, particularly agentic coding, and encouraged students to focus more on system design and problem solving rather than only writing code.

Towards the end of the talk,Ts.Abdul Alim stressed the importance of controlling and reviewing AI generated outputs, especially for critical systems. Overall,the industry talk broadened my understanding of current employer expectations, showing that strong programming skills should be complemented with project management and system development.He said that using AI to solve your problem is good but is it we learn how to solve it,it may make our live easier but believe me,if we dont know how to use it,it will be really dangerous in future.
