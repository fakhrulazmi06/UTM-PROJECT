## ASSIGNMENT 2

🗣️ **PPG Industry Talk | 20 November 2025**

I attended an industry talk at UTM featuring PPG, a global company that provides paints, coatings, and specialty materials to manufacturers worldwide. The talk mainly focused on how PPG’s IT department supports business operations through structured and well-managed systems.

The speaker explained the roles of key IT teams such as Data Analytics, Global IT Infrastructure, and SAP. These teams are responsible for data-driven decision making, cloud and infrastructure management, and integrating business processes through ERP systems. This session helped me understand how IT plays an important role in improving efficiency, communication, and coordination across a large organization.

Overall, the industry talk gave useful insights into real industry practices and helped bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world applications. My team and I summarized the key points from this session in a poster as part of our assignment.
